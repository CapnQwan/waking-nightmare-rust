# waking-nightmare - Core

Welcome to the Core of the waking nightmare crate, This is the core logic for the engine including the render and ECS (Entity, Component, Systems)

### Design Philosophy

The main design philosophy for this engine is to keep it modular and compact so that if this engine is used for web based games that the WASM files
will be as lightweight as possible so that both users and bots will be able to load pages quickly to bring both good SEO and UX potential whilst also
leveraging the potential of a WASM based project over just a pure JS/TS project

As this project is designed with modularity and build size in mind as this project develops you will be able to find more of the standard engine features **Such as:**

- Lighting
- Physics / Kinematics
- Inputs

within the modules crates within this project
