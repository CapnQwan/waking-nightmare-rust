# Waking-Nightmare - Event Bus

Welcome to the Event Bus for Waking Nightmare.
The event bus is a tool intended to help with clean data flow and interactions allowing for the likes of the UI to to interact with elements of other parts of the engine and editor without having to pass some sort of god context everywhere just to make everything work.
